# A context-aware genomic language model for gene spatial expression imputation, pattern detection, and function discovery


We develop the **SIGEL** which utilize self-supervised learning on **S**IGEL-**G**enerated **R**epresentations (SGRs) that can simultaneously identify spatially co-expressed genes and learn semantically meaningful gene embeddings from SRT data through a pretext task of gene clustering. **SIGEL** first employs an image encoder to transform the spatial expression maps of genes into gene embeddings modeled by a Student’s t mixture distribution (SMM). Subsequently, a discriminatively boosted gene clustering algorithm is applied on the posterior soft assignments of genes to the mixture components, iteratively adapting the parameters of the encoder and the SMM.
